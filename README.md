Submitted by: **Samuel Chibuoyim Uche**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Game of Thrones** is an android app that **displays a random character from the Game of Thrones API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòçüòäü§©**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **search by character name using an EditText input**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Displayed character image using Glide
- [x] Used Glide library to load images smoothly
- [x] Added error handling for failed API calls
- [x] Capitalized names and culture text for readability
 
 
 
 

## API Choice
